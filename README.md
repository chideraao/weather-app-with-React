## React Weather App

This weather app was created with guidance from a youtube tutorial by Tyler Potts. In the original tutorial, there was no seperation of state and i tried to implement that on my own and as an extra challenge, i attempted to add a Time component that updates every minute and also updates the weather in a selected location every minute(if any change).
